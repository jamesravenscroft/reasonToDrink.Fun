Full Stack Developer- prior to web Development I was a personal trainer. I've developed many client compliance systems and constantly pushed to improve automation and communications systems.

I've tinkered with programming video games for some 20 years since the days of Resource Editors on Power Macs back in the 90s. Prior to learning Javascript I had taken video game programming classes that have helped me learn bits and pieces of javascript logic functions.
